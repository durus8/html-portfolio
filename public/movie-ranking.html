<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Great story. One of the best works of Nolan</p>
<h3>Inglorious Bastards</h3>
<p>Brilliant action and direction. Top marks to Tarantino</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>All 3 parts of the series are worth watching over and over again. 
A master piece by Peter Jackson.</p>
